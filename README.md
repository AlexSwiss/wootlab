### Assumptions made
None

### Issues faced
It was a great challenge. The issues faced was trying to figure out how to track a location on a map. The best and efficient way.

A use case where the client closes his browser. the admin is going to lose track of the location data. A mobile app would've solved this to some extent.

### Feedback
The time frame to complete this was really small. If this can be extended i am sure the task will get 100% completed with all features.
